# Woohoo Labs. API Framework

**Woohoo Labs. API Framework is a flexible micro-framework developed for quality API-s.**

Our aim was to create an invisible, easily extensible, but first of all, extremely flexible framework for API-s.
We wanted to give you total control while providing a clean interface to communicate with.

## Introduction

#### "Long live is the framework"

The general problem with frameworks is that they suggest you using the set of tools they have. Initially,
everything seems to be OK, because either the scope of your project is too small or you are sure that you've found
the best framework ever. But as soon as your requirements change (e.g. things get more complicated, you have to
maintain the application longer than you thought or you need more scaling), there is a good chance that you will
face issues with your framework.

As [Phil Sturgeon](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon) pointed out in his great [blog post](http://philsturgeon.uk/blog/2014/01/the-framework-is-dead-long-live-the-framework),
in a complex enough situation, with a skilled enough development team, you don't need a framework at all in its
original meaning thanks to the modern era of Composer. All you need is only a set of inter-pluggable components
of your preference so that they can be easily integrated into your application.

In conclusion, requirements will always change. What seemed to be a good choice once, it is not enough next time.
If things are impossible to change in your framework then it might lead to hard times when refactoring your
application even though that it is decoupled from your project.

We created API Framework to remedy this issue.

#### A Case Study

Let's look at a realistic scenario to understand the problem better: you have an MVC framework which has its
integrated IoC Container and ORM layer. You are pretty happy with these tools. Some weeks later, you discover
that you would cache your database queries, but the interior ORM doesn't support it.

Next time you realize that you no longer need an MVC framework as you shifted away from this paradigm and
started adopting something else - let's say Domain Driven Design. Furthermore you want to reorganize your
project into bundles. Sadly, your framework neither supports changing the directory structure (it can
easily happen because of autoloading which came from the old times) nor calling your Controllers as Services
(you wanted to rename them because by now, your Controllers are rather Application Services).

Later on you will find yourself needing a much more sophisticated or performant IoC Container than the one
you have. Maybe you need Dice or PHP-DI. But the question emerges: how would you swap the core of the
framework which instantiates all your controllers? There is no way to do that. You can't overcome the
situation this time too (without hacking on the code).

#### Lessons Learned

The first situation had a grasp on that there are full stack and micro frameworks with a
long list of features and components, but in our opinion, a good framework should conform to the
[Single Responsibility Principle](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2014/05/08/SingleReponsibilityPrinciple.html):
they shouldn't provide more than that the user actually needs. For example if you won't make use of the
Eloquent ORM in Laravel, why placing it into the project? In the most cases it's better to just
create separate components and let the user decide which libraries they prefer.

The second lesson intended to teach you that it was a big mistake to leave everything as-is (e.g.:
class names, directory structure) despite the fact that the paradigm you use has been changed. When
developing quality software, naming must be in focus. According to DDD initiatives like Matthias
Verraes, finding expressive and consistent names for things is inevitable! As everything varies over
time, you mustn't let your framework restrict any changes or define the directory structure instead
of you. The advantage of this principle is well summarized by Anna-Julie Scheuermann:

> Once I'm happy with the names, I'm usually happy with the design.

Finally in the third story, we wanted to point out that changing routing or class instantiation in a
framework can be hard on-the-fly. But why not think about these situations in advance? For example,
regarding IoC Containers a (not yet officially accepted) common interface already exists, so it makes
any changes with them as easy as ABC!

As a general suggestion, when your project is huge make sure that you can easily swap things in and out
from every part of your framework too. That's why we designed API Framework so that almost every piece
of it can be changed with minimal effort and with minimal impact on your project.

#### Use Cases of Woohoo Labs. API Framework

Certainly, API Framework won't suit the needs of all projects and teams. Firstly, this framework works best
for advanced teams. So less experienced teams should probably choose a less lenient framework with more features
in order to speed up development in the initial phase.

To sum up, Woohoo Labs. API Framework is most effective for teams with a solid understanding of API development.
Its flexibility is more advantageous if you need sophisticated tools like IoC Containers or API documentation
tools like Swagger.

## Concepts

1. Configuration
2. Router
3. Container
4. Serializer/Deserializer
5. Request
6. Response
7. Event Dispatcher

#### Configuration

When you instantiate the framework you have to provide your configuration options including the current environment
of your application (DEV or PROD), caching etc. This configuration will be a POPO (Plain old PHP Object).

#### Router

Basically, the router tells you which handler (let it be a class method or an anomymous function) is in charge
of handling the request coming to a specific URI. The default router used by Woohoo Labs. API Framework is the
library of [Nikita Popov](https://twitter.com/nikita_ppv), because of its elegance and performance. You can read
more about it [clicking here](http://nikic.github.io/2014/02/18/Fast-request-routing-using-regular-expressions.html).
Of course if you weren't satisfied with it, you can change it anytime with a minimal amount of work.

| Implementation      | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `FastRouter     `   | Wrapper around the Fast Route library |

#### Container

For Woohoo Labs. API Framework, the container is only a class which is capable to instantiate any handlers
if you provide them their fully qualified class name (in fact, containers are called IoC Containers and
they are much more then described above). The built-in container is a really naive one: it uses pure PHP
reflection to create a handler object. If you want to use a more clever IoC Container which is
[Container-Interop compliant](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) (like PHP-DI), all
you have to do is to pass its reference to the framework.

If your chosen container doesn't support this interface (like Pimple or Dice), you only have to write an
adapter for them implementing the common interface.

| Implementation      | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `BasicContainer `   | Instantiates the handler classes with reflection |

#### Serializers/Deserializers

A deserializer automatically handles string to array/object conversion from data formats like JSON, XML or
YML. They may be needed in the beginning of the a request-response lifecycle when the framework receives a
request and the contained data (the body) should be converted into an array or object.

A serializer automatically handles array/object to string conversion into data formats like JSON, XML or YML.
They may be needed in the end of the request-response lifecycle when you want to send your data as a response.

| Implementation       | Supported formats | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `JmsSerializer`      | JSON, XML, YML    | A wrapper around the JmsSerializer library                  |
| `FormSerializer`     | form data         | Serializes/deserializes form data                           |
| `JsonSerializer`     | JSON              | Serializes/deserializes with pure PHP functions             |
| `CompoundSerializer` | any               | Supports choosing a serializer/deserializer for each format |
| `NaiveSerializer`    | -                 | Just transmits the received data                            |

#### Request

A request object is the Object-Oriented representation of an HTTP request. For this purpose,
Symfony's HTTP Foundation is used by a wrapper class which implements the ``RequestInterface``.

| 
| Implementation       | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FoundationRequest`  | A wrapper around the Symfony Foundation request class  |

#### Response

The response is the Object-Oriented representation of an HTTP response. It is capable to send itself
into the ether. For this purpose, Symfony's HTTP Foundation is used by default by a wrapper class.

| Implementation        | Description                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `FoundationResponse`  | A wrapper around the Symfony Foundation response class |

#### Event Dispatcher

An event dispatcher emits events during each phase of the control flow. These events can be listened
by listeners (they are callables or class methods) after you had them subscribed. Read more about it
in the Advanced Usage section.

| Implementation           | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `SymfonyEventDispatcher` | A wrapper around Symfony Event Dispatcher         |

## Install

The steps of this process are quite straightforward. The only thing you need is [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

#### Add API Framework to your composer.json:

To install this library, run the command below and you will get the latest version:

```bash
$ composer require woohoolabs/api-framework
```

#### Add the necessary dependencies:

If you want to use the default components (like the router, serializer, event dispatcher etc.) then you have to ask
for the following dependencies too:

```bash
$ composer require jms/serializer
$ composer require nikic/fast-route
$ composer require symfony/http-foundation
$ composer require symfony/event-dispatcher
$ composer require symfony/yaml
```

#### Update your dependencies with Composer:

```bash
$ composer update
```

#### Autoload classes in your bootstrap:

```php
require "vendor/autoload.php"
```

## Basic Usage

#### Configure the framework:

You have to create a configuration object for this step. In the example below, it will set the framework to run in
development mode and turn off caching:

```php
$config= new Config();
$config->setDevelopmentMode(true);
$config->setCaching(false);
```

#### Define some routes:

You have to define either a class or a callback handler for each route. A route consists of an HTTP verb and
a URI. By convention, start the URI with a _/_. It can also contain curly brace templates if you stay with
the default implementation.

```php
$config->setRoutes(function (RouterInterface $router) {
    $router->addCallbackRoute("GET", "/me", function (RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response) {
        $response->setContent("Welcome to the real world!");
    });
    
    $router->addRoute("GET", "/users", "App\\Controllers\\UserController", "getUsers");
    $router->addRoute("POST", "/users/{id}", "App\\Controllers\\UserController", "updateUser");
});
```

**Reminder**: As of PHP 5.5, you are able to use the [::class keyword](http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php#language.oop5.basic.class.class)
to resolve class names:

```php
$router->addRoute("GET", "/users", UserController::class, "getUsers");
```

#### Define the handlers for the routes:

There are two important things to notice here: each handler receives a ``RequestInterface`` and a ``ResponseInterface``
object and they are expected to manipulate the latter.

```php
namespace App\Controllers;

use WoohooLabs\ApiFramework\Request\RequestInterface;
use WoohooLabs\ApiFramework\Response\ResponseInterface;

class UserController
{
    /**
     * @param RequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     */
    public function getUsers(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
    {
        $users= ["Steve", "Arnie", "Jason", "Bud"];
        $response->setContent($users);
    }

    /**
     * @param RequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     */
     public function updateUser(RequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
     {
        $userId= $request->getUriParameter("id");
        $userData= $request->getBodyAsArray();
        $response->setContent(array_merge($userData, ["id" => $userId]));
     }
}
```

Of course, you should remain [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) and not
copy all this stuff with the initialization of the response throughout your handlers. Creating
an Adapter for the response or building a Factory should be fine.

However you don't have to worry that your handlers become tightly coupled to HTTP. Just read
[this fantastic post](https://igor.io/2013/02/03/http-foundation-value.html) from
[Igor Wiedler](https://twitter.com/igorwhiletrue).

#### Finally, launch the framework:

```php
$apiFramework= new ApiFramework($config);
$apiFramework->work();
```

## Advanced Usage

#### Redefining Default Components

The motivation of creating Woohoo Labs. API Framework was to become able to change every single aspect
of the framework. That's why you can customize almost all the aspects of framework with minimal effort.

The following example shows how to swap the ``BasicContainer`` with the PHP-DI Container then how to use the
serializer and deserializer of the famous JMS library instead of the default one.

```php
$router= new \DI\Container();
$apiFramework->setContainer($router);

$serializer= new JmsSerializer($config);
$apiFramework->setSerializer($serializer);

$deserializer= new JmsDeserializer($config);
$apiFramework->setDeserializer($deserializer);
```

#### Hooks

Hooking enables you to get the control before and/or after dispatching occurs. Note that it is only
available for class handlers! If you specify a ``preHook()`` method in your handler class then it
will be automatically invoked before the handler method. The same way, if you specify a ``postHook()``
method then it will be called after the original handler method has been invoked. Important to note
that these methods must expect a ``Request`` and a ``Response`` object as their only arguments and they
aren't required to provide any return value (see regular handlers).

Additionally you can even override the name of the hooks in the configuration: so if you have already
had a method like ``preDispatch()`` then you can use it easily!

#### Events

Listening to events is also possible with API Framework. You have to complete the following steps
if you want to use this functionality:

- Change the framework class in your code to ``EventApiFramework`` and the configuration class
to ``EventConfig``.

- Subscribe to the events in the configuration similar to the way you define the routes.

- You can customize which event dispatching library to use by calling
``EventApiFramework::setEventDispatcher()``. Of course this step is totally optional.

- If you stay with the default implementation, ensure you required the Symfony Event Dispatcher library in
your composer.json:

```bash
$ composer require symfony/event-dispatcher
```

Here is an example:

use WoohooLabs\ApiFramework\Event\EventDispatcherConsumerInterface;
use WoohooLabs\ApiFramework\Event\Events;
use WoohooLabs\ApiFramework\Event\EventInterface;

```php
$config= new EventConfig();
$config->setEvents(function (EventDispatcherConsumerInterface $eventDispatcher) {
    $eventDispatcher->addCallbackListener(
        Events::BEFORE_SENDING_RESPONSE,
        function (EventInterface $event) {
            echo "Request URI: " . $event->getRequest()->getUri() . "<br />";
            echo "Response Content-Type: " . $event->getResponse()->getContentType();
            exit();
        }
    );
});

$apiFramework= new EventApiFramework($config);
$apiFramework->work();
```

Note that your listeners always have to expect one argument with a type of ``EventInterface``. Depending
on the current phase of request-response lifecycle, this object can carry the request and/or the response objects (as
you can see above). Here is the list of the different events:

| Name                                 | Description                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ``Events::BEFORE_RECEIVING_REQUEST`` | Dispatched before the request object is instantiate.                         |
| ``Events::AFTER_RECEIVING_REQUEST``  | Dispatched after the instantiation of the request object                     |
| ``Events::AFTER_DISCOVERY``          | Dispatched after the routes have been defined but not yet dispatched         |
| ``Events::AFTER_ROUTING``            | Dispatched after the appropriate route has been selected but not yet handled |
| ``Events::BEFORE_SENDING_RESPONSE``  | Dispatched before sending the composed response                              |
